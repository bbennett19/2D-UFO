# 2D-UFO
Assignment 2 for CIS 510 Intro to Game Programming
## Project Overview
Built using Unity 5.6

The assignment requirements were to; follow the 2D UFO Unity tutorial, add a particle effect when collecting a pickup, add a sound when collecting a pickup, and add a significant gameplay feature.

For this I added:
1. Music (music from http://www.bensound.com/)
2. A particle effect that breaks the pickup into particles and each particle is magnetized to the player ship
3. I added two enemy types, one which chases the player endlessly and another which bounces around the play area at random
4. I added a particle effect for the player ship exploding when being hit by an enemy
